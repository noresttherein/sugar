/** A group of higher order functions and syntax extensions repeatedly or recursively applying other functions.
  *
  * The object itself provides an `apply` method which emulates the `repeat ... until ...` loops:
  * {{{
  *     repeat {
  *         sayBeep()
  *     } until (youAreMad())
  * }}}
  * The result of the whole expression is the value returned by the last invocation of the lazily evaluated expression
  * between `repeat` and [[net.noresttherein.slang.repeat.RepeatUntil.until until]]. You can also pass as the condition
  * a function accepting as an argument the result of the preceding execution:
  * {{{
  *     var genius = "bwa"
  *     val bwahaha = repeat {
  *         genius += "ha"; genius
  *     } until (_ == "bwahaha")
  * }}}
  *
  * Importing [[net.noresttherein.slang.repeat.repeatMethod repeatMethod]] extends values of any type with
  * a similar [[net.noresttherein.slang.repeat.repeatMethod.repeat repeat]] method, accepting as the body
  * of the loop a function applied first to `this`, and subsequently to the values returned by the previous applications:
  * {{{
  *     val kilo = 2 repeat (_ * 2) until (_ > 1000)
  * }}}
