/** `Clearable` is the opposite of [[net.noresttherein.slang.vars.Out Out]]: a value box initialized on construction,
  * but with its contents being subject to being cleared - unreferenced and freed for a garbage collector.
  * It is not a [[net.noresttherein.slang.vars.DisposableRef DisposableRef]] as it uses a hard reference
  * and must be cleared manually, rather than by the garbage collector. It is typically used for temporary data,
  * such as initializer blocks, which become no longer needed once the final content is created.
  * While this functionality can be in most cases covered by a simple `var`, a lack of a setter allows this type
  * to be covariant in its content type parameter `T`. Consider a pattern for lazily initialized values:
  * {{{
  *     trait B {
  *         @volatile protected var init :() => B
  *         @volatile private var cached :B = _
  *         def get :B = {
  *             val cons = init
  *             if (cons == null)
  *                 cached
  *              else {
  *                 cached = cons()
  *                 init = null
  *              }
  *              cached
  *         }
  *     }
  *
  *     Class A(value: => A) extends B {
  *         @volatile override var init :() => A = () => value
  *     }
  * }}}
  * Class `A` does not compile, because a `var` of type `B` cannot be overriden by a `var` of type `A`,
  * as property setters are contravariant. In this case we however do not need to assign arbitrary values
  * to the variable, only a `null`. The code above can be rewritten using `Clearable`:
  * {{{
  *     trait B {
  *         protected val init :Clearable[() => B]
  *         @volatile private var cached :B = _
  *         def get :B =
  *             init.asOption match {
  *                 case Some(cons) =>
  *                     cached = cons(); init.clear()
  *                 case _ => cached
  *             }
  *     }
  *     class A(value: => A) extends B {
  *         protected override val init = Clearable.volatile
  *     }
  * }}}
  *
  * For additional utility, this trait implements also Java [[AutoCloseable]]
  * and [[java.lang.ref.Cleaner.Cleanable Cleanable]].
