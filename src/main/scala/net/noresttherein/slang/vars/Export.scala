/** A boxed, thread-safe variable which value can become frozen at some point, causing all future reads to return
  * the same, frozen value. Its life cycle consists of two phases: during the initialization phase, the variable can
  * be mutated and read just as an atomic [[net.noresttherein.slang.vars.Atomic Atomic]] instance.
  * Once the [[net.noresttherein.slang.vars.Export.export export()]] method is called by any thread, the value
  * of the `@volatile` variable can no longer be updated, and the read-only phase begins. This phase transition
  * is also thread-safe: no writes will be lost. Any future updates to the variable will throw an `IllegalStateException`
  * and the variable will become from this point effectively immutable. As an optimization, its value is also copied
  * to a standard `var` which can be placed in the processor cache, bypassing the `@volatile` access penalty altogether.
  *
  * The difference between `Export[T]` and `Freezer[T]` lies in atomicity: in the latter, only the frozen, second
  * phase is thread-safe, and an update might be lost during freezing (it will be neither visible by any future read
  * nor will it fail with an exception). This variable is fully thread-safe in both phases at the cost of more expensive
  * access in the initialization phase. Additionally, this variable does not accept `null` values and will
  * throw a `NullPointerException` when assigned one.
  *
