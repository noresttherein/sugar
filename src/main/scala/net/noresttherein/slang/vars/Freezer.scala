/** A boxed variable whose value can become frozen at some point, causing all future reads to return the same,
  * frozen value. Its life cycle consists of two phases: during the initialization phase, the variable can
  * be mutated and read just as an synchronized [[net.noresttherein.slang.vars.Var Var]] instance, with writes
  * using no synchronization,This phase is not thread-safe, with no guarantees concerning the ordering of operations
  * or their atomicity. Once the [[net.noresttherein.slang.vars.Freezer.freeze freeze()]] method is called by any thread,
  * a ''release fence'' is invoked, synchronizing its value between the memory and processor cache, and the read-only
  * phase begins. Any future updates to the variable will throw a `IllegalStateException` and the variable will become
  * from this point effectively immutable and thread safe.
  *
  * The difference between `Export[T]` and `Freezer[T]` lies in atomicity: in this class, only the frozen, second
  * phase is thread-safe, and an update might be lost during freezing (it will be neither visible by any future read
  * nor will it fail with an exception). The latter is fully thread-safe in both phases at the cost of more expensive
  * access in the initialization phase.
  * @see [[net.noresttherein.slang.vars.Export Export]]
