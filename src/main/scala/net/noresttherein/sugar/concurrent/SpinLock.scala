/** A simple spin lock implementation based around a `@volatile` flag.
  * A `SpinLock` can be ''locked/closed'' or ''unlocked/open''. Entering a critical section requires
  * locking of the Lock with one of [[net.noresttherein.sugar.concurrent.SpinLock.lock lock]] methods;
  * leaving it involves unlocking with [[net.noresttherein.sugar.concurrent.SpinLock.unlock unlock]]
  * or [[net.noresttherein.sugar.concurrent.SpinLock.close close]]. Once locked, all threads attempting to lock it
  * will actively wait 'spinning' in a loop (possibly executing
  * [[java.lang.Thread Thread.]]`.`[[java.lang.Thread.sleep sleep]] between checks, if so instructed) until
  * the lock becomes open. The lock should be unlocked only by the thread which locked it, immediately upon completion
  * of the critical section. For advanced synchronization techniques, it is still possible to open the lock
  * by other threads using [[net.noresttherein.sugar.concurrent.SpinLock.forceOpen forceOpen]] instead of `unlock`.
  *
  * Additionally, any thread at any time can [[net.noresttherein.sugar.concurrent.SpinLock.break break]] the lock:
  * this will cause all future attempts to lock or unlock it to fail
  * with a [[net.noresttherein.sugar.concurrent.BrokenLockException BrokenLockException]], and any threads
  * currently executing one of the `lock` methods likewise exit it abruptly with the said exception.
  *
  * The class is obviously type safe, but optimised for minimal overhead in low contention scenarios and, especially,
  * for very brief critical sections, such as setting two variables in tandem. It should not be used for a heavily
  * demanded resource, or when resource usage time is on a level of magnitude approaching the execution time
  * of the entirety of the synchronised code.
