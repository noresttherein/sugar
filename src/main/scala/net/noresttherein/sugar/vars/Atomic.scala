/** Atomic variables providing several 'test-and-set' operations. They are very similar
  * to [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Volatile Volatile]], but unlike them, and unlike their Java counterparts,
  * value read happens only under [[java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.getAcquire getAcquire]]
  * and value write under [[java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.setRelease setRelease]] memory ordering guarantees,
  * unless done as a part of one of the atomic operations defined by [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.InOut InOut]]
  * interface.
  *
  * The effect roughly means that the value returned by this instance's getter will be at least as old as any value
  * read after that call in program order, while assignments to it will happen after any reads and writes preceding
  * them in program order - see the documentation of [[java.lang.invoke.VarHandle VarHandle]] for more specific
  * information.
  *
  * This makes this class slightly more efficient in highly contentious environment at the cost of lesser applicability.
  * It is best used as a flag controlling access to some other resource.
