	  * This class does not use a `synchronized` block, yielding a minor performance benefit
	  * while still remaining thread safe. It happens at the cost of possibly evaluating the initialization expression
	  * more than once, and concurrent access of an uninitialized value may return results from different calls.
	  * For this reason the initializer should be a relatively lightweight and '''idempotent''' function.
	  * By ''idempotent'' we mean here that the values returned by repeated calls should be ''equal''
	  * in terms of Scala `==`, that is, `equals` for reference types. The function does ''not'' need to
	  * return the same object all the time, that is its returned values need not be ''referentially'' equal
	  * (in terms of `eq`). This should be taken into account by client applications, which should not depend
	  * on subsequent calls to [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Val.get get]].
	  *
	  * For standard value types, access to an initialized value incurs no synchronization overhead,
	  * although this might be partially offset by unnecessary repeated execution of the initializer after stale reads.
	  * All testing functions become even less helpful, but at least it is guaranteed that once `isDefinite`
	  * returns `true`, it will always be so (in the sense of the java memory 'happens before' relation).
