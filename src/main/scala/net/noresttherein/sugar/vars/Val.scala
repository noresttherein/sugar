/** A supertype of wrappers of effectively immutable values with deferred initialization which do not change once set,
  * with all ''successful'' reads returning the same value. The chief implementation class is
  * [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Lazy Lazy]], but the value can be also set explicitly at a later time as in
  * [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Out Out]].
  *
  * One thing in common among all subclasses which differentiate them
  * from the contract of [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Ref Ref]] is that
  * [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Ref.get get]] (and [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Val.apply apply]]`()`
  * will always return a value, and always the same value for the same instance of `Val`.
  * How and when that value is computed is unspecified, and optional methods such as
  * [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Ref.opt opt]], [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Ref.? ?]]
  * and [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Ref.unsure asUnsure]] are allowed to return empty instances
  * if the value is not available at the moment of calling.
