/** A [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Volatile Volatile]]-like variable which additionally executes callback actions
  * each time its value is changed. This execution happens by default synchronously, in the thread which mutated
  * the variable, before the setter method returns. Any Java [[java.util.concurrent.Executor Executor]]
  * can be however provided as an implicit parameter at the time the variable is created.
  *
  * There are two collections of watchers associated with every instance: regular, presumably asynchronous watchers,
  * and synchronous watchers, registered with methods [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Watched.watch watch]]
  * and [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Watched.inSync inSync]], respectively. When and how the former are executed
  * in respect to the assignment call and each other is unspecified and depends solely on the provided `Executor`
  * implementation. While the default [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.Watched.SerialExecutor SerialExecutor]]
  * executes the callbacks in the thread which set the value of this variable, most 'real' implementations will
  * have it happen asynchronously with the setter call. The latter watchers are executed synchronously: regardless
  * of the `Executor` implementation, the mutating call to this variable will return only after all synchronous
  * watchers are executed, or any one of them throws a [[Throwable]] which is not an [[Exception]],
  * in which case the throwable is rethrown. Unless the executor in use is single threaded however, these callbacks
  * will be executed concurrently with each other.
  *
  * This variable kind is somewhat similar in application to [[net.noresttherein.sugar.vars.SignalVar SignalVar]]
  * in that both offer means for the application to react to changes in multi-threaded context. The difference
  * is that this variable is a rather straightforward implementation of the ''observer'' pattern, in which
  * the updating thread is the active side, at least scheduling the execution of callbacks, and possibly executing them
  * itself; on the other hand, `SignalVar` allows interested threads to synchronously wait on the variable
  * until a change to it is made and react themselves. The communication is asynchronous in both cases.
  *
