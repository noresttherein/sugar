/** Witnesses the existence of both `X` and `Y` implicit values. Declaring an implicit parameter
  * `(implicit both :X And Y)` is equivalent to declaring `(implicit x :X, y :Y)`, but the conjunction can still
  * be useful for creating more complex boolean formulas with implicit parameters as predicates.
  * Additionally, where one would normally introduce a new evidence type derived from existence of
  * some other implicit values, one can now simply declare a type alias for (possibly nested)
  * `And` values, saving the coding of a class, companion object and implicit values altogether.
