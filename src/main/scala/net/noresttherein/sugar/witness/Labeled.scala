/** A value class wrapper over any value with an additional associated label type distinguishing it from other instances.
  * It allows having multiple implicit values of the same type `T`, but distinguished by different labels.
  * By wrapping the intended values in `Labelled` instances the actual types of the implicit values differ, allowing
  * the client code to declare which value is of interested by the label type. This class is covariant both regarding
  * the wrapped type `T` and the `Label` type, so it is possible to declare implicit values with different
  * generalisation levels leveraging the subtyping of labels. Any type can be used for the label; in particular,
  * the singleton type of the wrapped object is a good unique label, although this level of coupling
  * will be often undesirable.
  * @param  get   the wrapped value.
  * @tparam T     the business type of this object.
  * @tparam Label any type, possibly phantom types, to use as a label differentiating this value from other possible
  *               wrappers of `T`.
